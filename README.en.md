## Frequently Asked Questions

* Why does the video source text return to the original configuration after opening the app again after configuring it remotely? <br>

If "Update video source after app launch" is turned on and the video source address exists, it will be automatically updated, which may overwrite the saved video source text. <br>

* Notes for compiling APP by yourself: <br>
1. Resource files need to be confirmed one by one and set to their own information, especially cloudflare.txt/github_private.txt/sources.txt<br>
Need to use the encryption and decryption tool website https://yourtvcrypto.horsenma.net to encrypt and store. <br>
2. The APK file I uploaded may not be synchronized with the source code. The APK file is relatively new, and the source code update is generally a few days behind. Please check it carefully. <br>
3. The encryption and decryption logic used in the APK file I uploaded is different from the encryption and decryption logic in the project: https://yourtvcrypto.horsenma.net, in order to protect my private resource information. <br>

## Apologies

I don't understand code, let alone development. I am just doing this to kill time. All codes are implemented by AI.
I don‚Äôt know how to use many functions on github yet.
